vBulletin Gallery - For vBulletin 4.0+

This is a simple yet effective way to show latest photos across all user public albums. Images are displayed using a masonry effect (similar to Pinterest). It uses jQuery and the Masonry plugin. 

This is still in beta and is being tested live at http://www.b15u.com/red_gallery.php

Installation:
Upload files in the upload directory
Import product file
Create a Navigation link to 'red_gallery.php'
If you enable caching, make sure the cache folder is set to 777

This gallery page is public by default as there is no usergroup restrictions yet. HOWEVER, you can set permissions on the navigation link.
